# robotTrading

This project contains all scripts to manage the trading automation process. Either one time or scheduled scripts will be placed here.

# File Structure

In order get the code tidy and organized, I use and define the basic structure of the file as follows.

|\-  &nbsp; root folder

\| &nbsp;&nbsp; \|---- Python  &nbsp;&nbsp;  # all scripts written in python

\| &nbsp;&nbsp; \|---- R    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  # all scripts written in R

\| &nbsp;&nbsp; \|---- DAG  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  # Schedules for all the automated scripts

\| &nbsp;&nbsp; \|---- SQL  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  # scripts related to querying (if exist)
